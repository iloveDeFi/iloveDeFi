Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

Originally, I started as a solo entrepreneur in e-commerce. Then I tried web design in a web agency. Through these small steps, I discovered my hidden gem: software development. At the end of 2021, I decided to get into this field by taking a crash course in JS and introductory computer science at Harvard. It was tough for a complete beginner, but I was fascinated.

I taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, React/React Native on the frontend and NodeJS, MongoDB and Express on the backend. I plan to join a one year training to consolidate my skills and finally apply for a job.

I am also passionate about blockchain technology and the issues that come with it. I have started learning Solidity. This is my long term goal ðŸ˜‡

I admire the level of other developers, I realize how little I know but I am really excited to improve my web dev skills to join a tech company.
